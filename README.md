Image Picka
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eight04/image-picka.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eight04/image-picka)

An image picker written in webextensions.

Features
--------

* Download an image with drag-n-drop or ctrl/shift/alt + click.
* Show download button on hover.
* Batch download all images from current tab or tabs to the right.
	- Filter images according to
		- min width
		- min height
		- file size
		- image URL
	- Copy URLs of selected images.
* Customized filename.
* Handle invalid characters in filename.
* Download from browser cache.
* Transform URLs with find-and-replace.

Filename pattern
----------------

Filename may contain following `${variable}`s:

* `index`: an increasing number represent the index of the image. Only available in batch download.
* `url`: entire URL of the image.
* `hostname`: hostname extracted from `url`. (e.g. `http://example.com/abc.jpg` -> `example.com`)
* `name`: filename extracted from `url`. (e.g. `http://example.com/abc.jpg` -> `abc`)
* `ext`: file extension extracted from `url`. If the URL doesn't contain the extension, it uses the default extension which can be set in option page.
* `pageTitle`: title of the page.
* `pageUrl`: URL of the page.
* `pageHostname`: hostname extracted from `pageUrl`.
* `date`: an instance of JavaScript `Date`.
* `dateString`: a date string in format `year-month-day hour minute second` e.g. `2018-01-18 08 28 56`.

Some notes for iframe:

* When downloading with drag-n-drop
	- `pageTitle`, `pageUrl`, etc, are grabbed from the top window.
* When batch downloading
	- `pageTitle`, `pageUrl`, etc, are grabbed from the window of the iframe.

Feel free to open an issue to discuss this behavior if you think this is not right.

Use expression in filename
--------------------------

If this option is checked, the extension would evaluate the content inside `${}` as simple expressions, by using [expression-eval](https://github.com/donmccurdy/expression-eval).

Here are some examples:

* Fallback to `pageUrl` when `pageTitle` is empty:
	```
	Image Picka/${pageTitle||pageUrl}/${index} - ${name}${ext}
	```
* Make `index` start from `0`:
	```
	Image Picka/${pageTitle}/${index-1} - ${name}${ext}
	```
* Zero-pad `index`:
	```
	Image Picka/${pageTitle}/${String(index).padStart(3,"0")} - ${name}${ext}
	```
* Slice the filename:
	```
	Image Picka/${pageTitle}/${index} - ${name.slice(-6)}${ext}
	```
	
The expression can access variable methods and global object `String`, `Number`, and `Math`.
	
Transform URL with regexp
-------------------------

If the site displays a thumbnail image, you can transform the URL to its full size URL with this feature, by defining multiple replace rules in the code box. For example:

```
# baidu
imgsa\.baidu\.com/.+/(\w+\.\w+)$
imgsrc.baidu.com/forum/pic/item/$1

# twitter
pbs\.twimg\.com/media/(.+\.\w+)$
pbs.twimg.com/media/$1:orig
```

* Each replace rule includes:
	- A line of regex.
	- A line of replacement.
* Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
* Empty lines are ignored.

Domain blacklist
----------------

There are some sites which we don't need to download images from it. The blacklist allows you to disable "Download Single Image" feature (i.e. drag-n-drop, single-click download, and hover button) in specified domains. For example:

```
example.com
*.example.com
```

*Note that `*.example.com` doesn't match `https://example.com/` but `https://sub.domain.example.com/`.*

Escape special characters
-------------------------

To generate valid filenames, the extension escapes following characters into Unicode glyphs:

|Character|Unicode replacement|
|---|---|
|`/`|`／`|
|`\`|`＼`|
|`?`|`？`|
|`\|`|`｜`|
|`<`|`＜`|
|`>`|`＞`|
|`:`|`：`|
|`"`|`＂`|
|`*`|`＊`|
|`~`|`～`|

This should be fine for most of the time. However, in some very old environments, they may have problems reading unicode filenames. By unchecking "escape into unicode glyphs" option, special charaters would be replaced with a single underscore: `_`.

Icon color
----------

If you are using a dark theme and the icon color doesn't fit your theme, or the icon is completely transparent, try:

1. Set `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` to `true` in `about:config`.
2. If the config doesn't exist (e.g. in Firefox ESR 52), you have to specify a proper color manually.
